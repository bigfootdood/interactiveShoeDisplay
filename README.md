# interactiveShoeDisplay

This was a spur-of-the-moment project completed in roughly two days time.

## The Idea

Build a website that could act as a static 'digital billboard' until a camera recognizes a person in front of it. The website then launches an augmented-reality style app where the user can use their hand to make a product selection. Once selected, A QR code is shown on the screen where the user can pull out their phone and see a 3d Augmented reality view of the product they selected.

## Status

* I made a functioning prototype using Posenet which is a Tenserflow model for pose estimation. The model tracks a users hand for making a selection and the augmented-reality phone portion of the site is handled by AR.js, an augmented reality framework based on WebGL & Three.js
* I'm not planning on finishing this project as it was meant to be a rough proof of concept. :)
